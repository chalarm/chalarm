A pragmatic realist born in 1986 (this makes me a Chernobyl baby) in Rotterdam, The Netherlands.

Got fascinated with computers at the early age of 6 at which I've changed my Super Nintento for a Commodore 64. After breaking my grandpa's digital calculator for years before that.

Here I've started basic programming and it wasn't long after this that i got my first "real computer" a IBM with a Intel 80386DX. From here we super-warped into Intel 166MHz, AMD 800MHz and after this I've lost track what my next step was since i then got laptops/notebooks instead believe a whopping 1.8GHz or 2GHz - can't recall it exactly anymore hence who cares. It's not about CPU power anymore for most of our chores.

I've saw pretty much every operating system from:

    BSD (Dragonfly,Free,Net,Open)
    Commodore KERNAL/Commodore BASIC 2.0 GEOS
    Linux (various distro types)
    MS-DOS 6.22
    Solaris
    Windows 95,NT4,98,Millennium Edition,2000,2003,2008,2016 (2012 I've skipped for some reason - I'm not the biggest Windows fan)

Worked as a system engineer was more fascinated by the networking side of life.

Brocade, Cisco, Extreme, Juniper, Nokia they all have no secrets for me and they all have bugs. I've been operating at Expert level within (Large) Enterprise & Service Provider networks for 15+ years (protocols like BGP, OSPF, IS-IS, MPLS, VPLS). 

Now ever since Corona happened I'm pretty much isolated in Thailand.
